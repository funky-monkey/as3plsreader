## What is it? ##
This Playlist reader for Adobe AIR / Actionscript 3 allows you to read and write PLS and M3U files. [PLS files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLS_(file_format)) and M3U Files are Playlist files used by alot of audio programs. Programs like iTunes, Real player, Winamp, VLC media player and Foobar play these formats without any extra codecs required.

## Future Features ##
Future features will allow you to read and write [B4S](http://forums.winamp.com/printthread.php?threadid=65772) and [XSPF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSPF) playlist formats.
You can always ask for features if you think there is something missing! You can do that [in the issue section](http://code.google.com/p/as3plsreader/issues/list).


## Working on right now... ##
  * Re-writing the parsing for better results
  * Creating API Documentation.

## Why to use? ##
Examples are:
  * You can use it to read generated play lists and listen to music from a server (or use it on your own files locally)
  * Extract all the URLs from a PLS file and create an streaming radio player application in AIR
  * The possibilities are endless!

## How to use? ##

Happy coding :)
